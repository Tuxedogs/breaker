# Introduction

Moonbreaker uses a docs-first architecture with layout primitives only:

- `Header`
- `Sidebar`
- `PageLayout`

Navigation is data-driven through `src/nav.ts`, which keeps content routing declarative and easy to extend.

## Visual Style

The interface uses translucent surfaces, subtle blur, low-opacity fills, and thin borders.

No opaque white panels are used.
