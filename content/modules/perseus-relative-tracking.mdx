steps: ["Establish alignment with desired component on the target ship, remain oriented aft of the enemy.", "Focus pressure on vulnerable components.", "Coordinate pitch and controlled thrust to maintain stable tracking.", "Use lateral thrust only as needed; avoid destabilizing turret firing windows.", "Use mains in event of possible collision, or when the target attempts to break off the maneuver. Short bursts of boost."]
